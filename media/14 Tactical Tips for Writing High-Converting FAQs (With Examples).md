## 14 Expert Tips for Writing FAQs That Convert

### **1. Talk to Your Customers**
The best way to know what questions to include in your FAQ is to ask your existing customers. What concerns did they have before buying? Use their feedback to create your FAQ.

### **2. Start with Generic Questions**
Not sure where to begin? Look at industry-specific FAQs for inspiration. Address basic customer concerns like pricing, shipping, and product guarantees.

### **3. Add a Call-to-Action (CTA)**
Don’t stop at answering questions—guide users to the next step. Add a CTA like "Start Your Free Trial" or "Learn More" at the end of each FAQ.

### **4. Include Social Proof**
Place testimonials or success stories near your FAQs to reassure potential buyers. For example:
> "96% of our customers recommend [Leadpages](https://bit.ly/LEadPages) for their landing page needs."

### **5. Use Conversational Language**
Write as if you’re speaking directly to your customers. Use "I" and "you" to make the FAQ feel more personal.

### **6. Position FAQs Strategically**
Place FAQs where they’ll have the most impact—like on your pricing or product pages.

### **7. Use Visual Cues**
Break up text with icons, images, or videos to make the FAQs easier to navigate.

### **8. Get Creative**
Add personality to your FAQs. A quirky tone or humorous example can make your answers memorable.

### **9. Use Drop-Down Menus**
Avoid overwhelming users with walls of text. Use expandable drop-downs to keep your FAQ organized.

### **10. Address Unasked Questions**
Think of questions your customers might not know to ask but would benefit from. For example: 
> "Can you help me with SEO too?" 

### **11. Integrate Video**
Add video responses to key questions for a personal touch. Example: McDonald’s answering why their food looks different in ads.

### **12. Crowdsource Your FAQs**
Ask loyal customers to write answers in their own words. Their testimonials will resonate with potential buyers.

### **13. Follow Up with Leads**
Email FAQs to prospects who haven’t converted yet. Include a line like:
> "If you didn’t see your question here, reply, and we’ll get back to you!"

### **14. Create Landing Pages for FAQs**
Turn high-priority questions into blog posts or dedicated landing pages. Link these pages within your FAQ for SEO benefits and detailed answers.
