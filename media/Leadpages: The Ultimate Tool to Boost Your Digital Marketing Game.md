### 2. **LeadBoxes for Better Conversions**
One of Leadpages' standout features is **LeadBoxes**, customizable pop-ups that can be added to your website, blog, or other digital assets. These pop-ups can be triggered by user actions such as clicking a button or hovering over text. You can also set timers for pop-ups to appear after a visitor spends a specific amount of time on your site. The **Exit LeadBox** is especially powerful—it displays just as a visitor is about to leave, giving you one last chance to capture their attention.

### 3. **Native Ad Creation**
Leadpages enables you to create Facebook and Instagram ads directly within the platform. This feature automates the process by pulling content from your landing page, allowing you to quickly edit and publish ads that drive traffic. Plus, Leadpages automatically integrates Facebook Pixel into your pages for retargeting and analytics, giving you actionable insights to refine your campaigns.

### 4. **Split Testing for Optimization**
A/B testing is crucial for maximizing conversion rates, and Leadpages makes it effortless. Test multiple versions of your landing pages side-by-side to see which design, headline, or CTA performs best. Use data-driven insights to refine your strategy and improve results.
